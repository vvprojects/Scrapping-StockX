Originally seen on the Air Jordan 23 ""Neapolitan,"" the Neapolitan colorway adds a soft touch to the classic Dunk Low silhouette. Summit White is the base color and can be found across the upper, the midsole, and the sockliner. The color-blocked forefoot and heel overlays display Light Orewood Brown, while the Swoosh logos on the side panels feature chocolatey Baroque Brown.

<br>
<br>
While the Cream Sweet Pink ASICS GEL-Kayano 14’s mesh construction, including the web of faux-leather overlays and mesh underlays, pays homage to GEL-Kayano models from the early 2000s, the use of shiny metallic silver gives the sneaker a futuristic upgrade. In addition, Sweet Pink accents add pops of color on the midsole pods, the ASICS branding, and the rubber outsole. Toshikazu Kayano didn’t design this version of the GEL-Kayano; however, the shoe still maintains its iconic layered construction and GEL technology underfoot. This cushioning system provides advanced shock absorption without weighing down the foot.

While the silhouette hearkens back to the original shoe from 1985, the fuzzy white laces and Foam Pink paw prints give the Paw Print Pink Foam (Women's) Jordan 1 Low SE a modern yet cute upgrade. However, the sneaker still maintains its premium leather construction with a white base and Pink Foam on the mudguard, eyestays, and heel detailing. The Glacial Blue Swoosh logo adds a pop of color and tonally matches the embroidered Air Jordan Wings logo on the heel. An encapsulated Air-Sole unit cushions against impact, while the rubber outsole provides durable traction.

<br>
<br>
Something that makes this shoe stand out is the Gore-Tex along the upper. It helps keep the foot dry without adding weight or sacrificing comfort. The sneaker boasts an all-black construction with Wolf Gray and reflective detailing. Flecks of reflective material in the laces and a strip along the side panels improve visibility in low lighting and add a pop of silver. Unlike other trail running sneakers, this version of the React Pegasus Trail 4 has less rubber on the outsole. This allows the runner to transition from rough terrain to pavement. Other notable features include the full-length Boost unit in the midsole and the grippy traction pattern underfoot.

One of Donovan Mitchell’s key phrases is ""Determination Over Negativity"" which is evident on and off the court.

Although the White Malachite Green Off White Midsole (Women's) ASICS Gel-1130 draws inspiration from models in the GEL-1000 series, it offers modern upgrades and a contemporary colorway. Gel cushioning in the heel provides superior shock absorption, while the white mesh underlays and synthetic leather overlays maintain the sneaker’s design from 2008. In addition, the Trusstic support system in the midsole is borrowed from stability running shoes from the late 2000s. Splashes of Malachite Green can be found on the formstripe, the branding, and the segments on the heel, giving the sneaker a modern upgrade.

The Preloved Brown colorway of the Luxe adidas Samba OG features an upper of rich brown suede with padding at the collar for enhanced comfort. Brown suede overlays adorn the eyestays and the toebox in a T-toe formation. Cream-colored leather is used to craft both the heel tab and the iconic side-panel three stripes. The brown laces and brown textile sock liner, along with the brown suede tongue, complete the look of this elegant upper. The brown rubber outsole features undulating grooves and concentric circles in order to provide traction and shock absorption, and this rubber runs up the sidewalls, as well.

Over the years, Kanye’s influence has grown tremendously and in no place is it more evident than the sneaker world.

Without an official connection to Kanye, these never reached the price levels of Yeezys.

The first colorway of the adidas Yeezy Boost 750, which is technically Brown/Carbon White/Light Brown but most commonly referred to as grey, released over NBA All-Star Weekend that took place in New York City that year. To make things fair and safe for customers, adidas launched an app to handle reservations. If you were lucky enough to get through on the app you were able to pick up your Yeezy Boosts from a nearby retailer. Kanye and adidas went above and beyond with extra personnel to make sure that every person who obtained a pair was able to pick up their pair safely. The Yeezy 750 is a bold design featuring a high cut and zippered ankle, and because of it, many sneakerheads scoffed at the shoe. The design is one of the first shoes from adidas to feature almost no visual branding. Even the Three Stripes are tucked away underneath the midfoot strap. To help launch the shoe, Kanye West and adidas held a fashion show in NYC for Kanye’s Yeezy Season 1 and live streamed the show to 42 movie theaters across the globe. To make the launch even more special for Yeezy fans, Kanye West surprised some of those who purchased the adidas Yeezy Boost by handing them their new Yeezy sneakers in person.""",adidas Yeezy Boost 750,sneakers,https://images.stockx.com/images/Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-750-Brown-Product.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=140&h=100&fm=webp&auto=compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1738193358,https://images.stockx.com/images/Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-750-Brown-Product.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=300&h=214&fm=webp&auto=compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1738193358,871.0,2025-02-25T07:47:29Z,1698.0,2025-02-23T11:33:02Z,0,0,,1360,0.25528,8,3.877,0,1707,2015-02-14

2742,White Black Green,puma-cell-endura-white-black-green,Puma Cell Endura White Black Green,Puma,"During the 90s running technology boom, Puma created Cell Technology, one of the most durable and resilient cushioning technologies of the day. Twenty years later, they celebrate by reissuing a classic from the Puma Archive: The Cell Endura in a vibrant white, black and green colorway.

In 1998, Puma introduced the first iteration of Cell Technology for stable cushioning. Stability came from blow-molded polyurethane elastomer (TPU) that was configured in a pattern of hexagonal cells. Combinations of these cells allowed Puma to engineer cushioning and solve problems for a variety of running needs.

With distinctive eyelets, a chunky silhouette, and its green Cell Technology, the Cell Endura has stayed true to its OG glory, updated with new materials and new production techniques. It maintains the detailing of the original model along with the rubber toe cap plus a unique eyelet stay for the laces. The sneaker was referenced from the Puma Archive and reworked to create a sleeker toe shape. The original Cell Endura was hand-stitched but this version has evolved with the times and features digital stitching. A breathable mesh upper with suede overlays and PU coated leather overlays cover the upper which sits atop an EVA midsole and rubber outsole.

The Cell Endura drops on October 4th in leading sneaker stores, Puma.com and Puma stores worldwide.
